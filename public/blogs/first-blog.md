# Building Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles

Autonomous ground vehicles (UGVs) are at the core of modern robotics research, combining perception, decision-making, and control into a single intelligent system.

At **UGV Tech Team, DTU**, our goal is to design vehicles that can operate reliably in real-world environments with minimal human intervention.

## Why Autonomous UGVs Matter

UGVs have applications across many domains:

- Space exploration and planetary rovers  
- Defense and reconnaissance  
- Disaster response and search & rescue  
- Autonomous logistics and delivery  

By focusing on autonomy, we aim to push the limits of what ground robots can achieve.

## Core Building Blocks

An autonomous UGV typically consists of:

### 1. Perception  
Sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS help the robot understand its surroundings.

### 2. Localization  
Algorithms like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) allow the robot to estimate its position accurately.

### 3. Planning  
Path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms decide *where* the robot should move.

### 4. Control  
Low-level controllers translate planned paths into motor commands.

## Our Approach at UGV DTU

We adopt a **modular architecture**, allowing us to improve individual subsystems without affecting the entire stack.

Each generation of our vehicles incorporates lessons learned from real-world testing and competitions.

## What’s Next?

As competitions and research challenges evolve, so does our technology.  
In upcoming blogs, we’ll dive deeper into:

- Sensor fusion techniques  
- Real-time navigation  
- Robust autonomy under uncertainty
